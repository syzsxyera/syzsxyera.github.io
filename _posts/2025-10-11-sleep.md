I am starting to watch English podcast on youtube today. It's still hard to understand every part, but it's enjoyable. Today topic was sleep or rest. Many people said adult have only six hours of sleep. It’s a quarter of a day. For me, I have seven to eight hours of sleep. But my sleep quality wasn't good enough. Maybe listening to a fun podcast before sleep will help increase quality of my sleep.
