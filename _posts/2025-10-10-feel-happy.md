Today I feel tired because I walked a bit. It barely reaches a thousand steps, but i guess I lack training. That's summary of my day, let us get right into the topic. Happy is a feeling, but everyone has a different definition of it. I am happy when I can eat french fries. When i got new phone, and trying to test it i feel happy. So what's you definition of happy?
